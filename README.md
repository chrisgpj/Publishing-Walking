# Publishing Walking

## Introduction
In October 2022, I prepared a publicaiton of Walking, by Henry David Thoreau. The purpose of the publicaiton was to use of my skills as a craftsman to make physical books. 

The work I put into preparing the actual text was significant. However, I have decided to make that contirbution available. This includes my efforts in preparing the digital manuscript, a citation scheme, and notes of the text. 

For this publication, I want to be paid as a maker, only.

Handcraft is going against the grain in a society that has so many abstract, non-material services, which has distanced itself so much from material and ecological processes. Even jobs directly involved with sustainability are prone to this phenomenon. I am equipped for such work and often enjoy it. However, I have decided that it is important to go against the grain, now and then. Therefore, I am seeking a modest wage for that which would often be  off-sourced; and I am doing what work I can that would usually belong to a high-paid service job in my own time.
