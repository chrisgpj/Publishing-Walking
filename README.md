# Publishing Walking
The purpose of this project is to craft a pathway from valid TEI XML markup through to a high-quality typesetting of _Walking_ by Henry David Thoreau for physical publication.

##Why it begins with XML
Markup in XML, and the TEI schema in particular, has the benefit of clarity and fully descriptive markup, and it encourages exposition. Things like the manuscript description abilities of TEI XML are hugely important typesetting alone, and only become more so if editorial comments or essays are undertaken. An immediate example that comes to mind is the characteristic use of the *,-* punctuation, a period-idiosyncracy that, if preserved, adds charm to the text and allows a more accurate reading - but it has to be rendered sensitively in the typesetting for this to be achieved.

##Where it will end up
The typesetting will be done using TeX or LaTeX. There is, I feel, an assumed aesthetic to LaTex which is created by a combination of template-use and academic publishing style. However, my experience is that this typsetting software can excell at quality of typesetting for books as well, if care is taken. The added benefit of typesetting with TeX is that almost everyone can replicated the process for free.

##Why a workflow is necesary
This project aims to explore and ultimately implement custom-written codes in Python programming language rather than using tools like XLST and OxGarage. The former is highly dependent on XML parsing software, and the latter creates an overly complicated typesetting without embracing customisation of the process.

In doing this project I am backing the idea that a workflow using free open-source software can be well-crafted and well-documented such that it opens accessibility to many more people. One result of this idea will be the elimination of assumptions. It will not be assumed that the people interested in replicating the workflow have a certain software, or particular programming knowledge. Instead, I will take people on the journey that I will have to go on to complete this project, linking the resources and writing the explanations necessary to ensure robustness and replicability. I hope that the only assumption that remains will be the ability to put time and effort into carefully reading, comprehending, and practicing.
