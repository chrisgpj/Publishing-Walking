# Publishing Walking

## The Project

The aim of this project is to create and document a workflow that transforms a mark up of a text with valid TEI XML (Text Encoding Initiative Extensible Markup Language) into a descriptive LaTeX markup of the text. The aim is that, from that point, little work will be needed for someone familiar with LaTeX to prepare the desired typeset. In this workflow, effort is invested in a general description of the text, rather than a specific typesetting application.

## The Publicaton Project and Availability of My Notes

In October 2022, I prepared a publicaiton of Walking, by Henry David Thoreau. The purpose of the publicaiton was to use of my skills as a craftsman to make physical books. 

The work I put into preparing the actual text was significant. However, I have decided to make that contirbution available. This includes my efforts in preparing the digital manuscript, a citation scheme, and notes of the text. 

For this publication, I want to be paid as a craftsman, only.

Handcraft is going against the grain in a society that has so many abstract, non-material services, which has distanced itself so much from material and ecological processes. Even jobs directly involved with 'sustainability' are prone to this phenomenon. I am equipped for such work and often enjoy it. However, I have decided that it is important to go against the grain, now and then. Therefore, I am seeking a modest wage for that which would often be  off-sourced; and I am doing what work I can that would usually belong to a higher-paid service job in my own time.

## Repository Contents

The pdf of _Walking_ will be uplaoded after I have completed the first batch of hand-made books.

The pdf supplied is **not** the same one I have used for physical publication; it is prepared for digital reading.

## Copyright

See the front copyright page in the pdf of _Walking_.

## Thanks are Given To:

Everyone who has supported me and purchased my books.

## How To Give Credit

It will be seen from the front copyright page that you must credit to me when you distribute or use the parts that are my work. The initals used in the book are C.G.P.J.; my name is Christopher Jolly. Again, whether you have to use my name, or not, depends on what part of the text you are working with. If you need to reference Thoreau's work in a scholarly capacity, I recommend using The Reader's Thoreau.
