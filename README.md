# Publishing Walking

In October 2022 I prepared a publicaiton of Walking, by Henry David Thoreau. The purpose of the publicaiton was to make the physical books using. The project is steeped in handcraft.

After some consideration, I have decided to make my contributions available. This includes my efforts in preparing the manuscript, a citation scheme, and various notes on the text. Please see the copyright page of the publication for more information.

Over the last decades of material excess in the developed nations, we have been able to pay for unneccessary non-material services, while neglecting some of those unpaid services which give us the most joy, or in some cases entirely overlooking deeply essential paid services; despite material needs being met so prolifically, commuinities have lost the ability to find enjoyement in making things — even when doing so would be an astonishing efficiency, working in cooperation with modern technology.

For this publication, I am a maker: whatever payment I recieve is a modest wage for this alone. I live in a modern industrial nation-state. Handcraft is no always a practical thing to do for a living, and I have made way doing other things as well — I continue to do some of these things, since I consider them necessary. However, there comes a time when I, for once, want payment to come from a responsible engagement with materials, rather than from an unneccessary service that I feel to be reliant on the irresponsible use of materials. There is room enough in the society for much more than we realise, especially when it comes to activities which do more with less. We should try and realise that soon, because the future will be much better for it.
