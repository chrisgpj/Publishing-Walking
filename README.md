# Publishing Walking

## The Project

The aim of this project is to create and document a workflow that transforms a mark up of a text with valid TEI XML (Text Encoding Initiative Extensible Markup Language) into a descriptive LaTeX markup of the text. The aim is that, from that point, little work will be needed for someone familiar with LaTeX to prepare the desired typeset. In this workflow, effort is invested in a general description of the text, rather than a specific typesetting application.

## The Publicaton Project and Availability of My Notes

In October 2022, I prepared a publicaiton of Walking, by Henry David Thoreau. The purpose of the publicaiton was to use of my skills as a craftsman to make physical books. 

The work I put into preparing the actual text was significant. However, I have decided to make that contirbution available. This includes my efforts in preparing the digital manuscript, a citation scheme, and notes of the text. 

For this publication, I want to be paid as a craftsman, only.

## Repository Contents

The pdf of _Walking_ will be uplaoded after I have completed the first batch of hand-made books.

The pdf supplied is **not** the same one I have used for physical publication; it is prepared for digital reading.

## Copyright

See the front copyright page in the pdf of _Walking_.

## Thanks are Given To:

Everyone who has supported me and purchased my books.

## How To Give Credit

It will be seen from the front copyright page that you must credit to me when you distribute or use the parts that are my work. The initals used in the book are C.G.P.J.; my name is Christopher Jolly. Again, whether you have to use my name, or not, depends on what part of the text you are working with. If you need to reference Thoreau's work in a scholarly capacity, I recommend using The Reader's Thoreau; or you may wish to reference the page numbers of my rare, un-identified publication, just to remind people how annoying tracing references can be in the arts.

## Fundraising
If you find value in anything I am doing, but don't want to accumulate unnecessary physcial posessions, you can `buy the maker a coffee' on my wesbite: PilgrimNotebooks.com.au.

For every $50 AUD recieved from this channel, an old book will be restored and donated to a local library or auctioned for charity. If the book is restored with leather and/or the binding is finer, the book will correpsond to $100. This restoration activity is one that I do so long as I have materials, but in the spirit of prioritising craftsmanship as a worthwhile activity, I will ensure any contributions recieved are accompanied by time and material put to restoring books; if the donation portal is closed, then it means I do not have any restorations lined up. The current project is: The Poems of Henry W Longfellow, printed 1882, restorted in leather.
